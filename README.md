# API Documentation for Frontend Developers

# Very important notes

## PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING

#### 1. To start the server, you must first install Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Then, clone this project by running the following command in a working directory `git clone git@github.com:d8rp/the-entrepreneur-website.git`. Then, open the console in the project folder and run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up`. The server should now be accesible on `localhost:3000`.

#### 2. All the static files like HTML, CSS, JS and images must be stored in the public folder after you cloned the project.

All the URLs are extension of the base URL of {**_insert domain here_**}.
For example, if the domain is foo.com and the URL in the documentation is `/something` then the URL in the browser should be `foo.com/something`.
<br></br>
However, requests should still be made using the URL in the docs like so:

```javascript
fetch("/something")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // Do Something
  });
```

    "message": "An error occurred",
    "status": 500
  }
}
```

- Let me know if you want errors to be done differently

# Posts (WIP)

## JSON format

It's written in pairs of `Name: Type`

### 1. Post:

```json
{
   "title": string,
   "authorId": string,
   "datePublished": Date,
   "imageURL": string,
   "summary": string,
   "postBody": Object[], // Object is a JSON, [] mean its an array
}
```

Every single property should exist but the frontend currently only need to send in the body this in FormData:

```json
{
   "title": string,
   "summary": string,
   "postBody": Object, // Object is a JSON, see "2. postBody" for more information
}
```

To supply the post with an image for the banner, a form with the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` type must be present and a `<input>` with property `name="image"` (only a single image is allowed). Remember to send the data though FormData if you're using javascript to send the request.
<br></br>

#### Example file input html:

`<input type="file" id="imageUpload" name="image" accept="image/*">`<br></br>
Put this in a form

### 2. postBody:

Only one element must exist in the each JSON:

```json
{
   "paragraph?": string, // ? means that it might not exists
   "header?": string,
   "quote?": string,
}
```
